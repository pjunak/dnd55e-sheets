# dnd55e-sheets

A **fully hand-fillable D&D 5.5e (2024) character sheet** addon for
[ttrpg-codex](https://github.com/pjunak/ttrpg-codex) (the *O Barvách Draků* CodexHost
framework). Addon id: `dnd55e-sheets`.

The sheet stores its D&D data per character in `character.addonData['dnd55e-sheets']`
— it does **not** own a collection, and it does **not** duplicate anything the host
already owns (name, portrait, species, lore, relationships). It integrates by claiming
the host's character `body` fragment (`registerFragmentOp` · replace) and turning it
into a tab strip, so the host's side-card and relationship sections render natively
above it.

## What it does

The character's native page **is** the Overview: portrait, lore, connections and facts
stay exactly where the host puts them. The addon turns the lore block into the first
tab of a strip and adds the D&D tabs after it:

- **Overview** — the host's own description (lore), reused as tab 1 (not copied).
- **Character Sheet** — D&D identity (class/level/background/alignment), ability scores,
  saving throws, skills, mechanical notes.
- **Combat** — attacks from equipped/ready weapons + resource trackers (Rage, Ki, slots…).
- **Spellbook** — prepared/cantrip slots, granted & choose-grant sections, extras
  (shown only when the character has spells).
- **Backpack** — inventory grouped by carry location + currency.
- **Builder** — guided progression; rightmost, only with the rules engine and only for
  editors.

A slim **vitals bar** (HP with live **+/-**, AC, Initiative, Speed, Proficiency, Passive
Perception, plus a class-level line) sits under the tabs on the mechanical tabs.

**Editing is direct and role-gated — there is no separate "edit mode" and no second edit
button.** The host's own **✏ Upravit** owns identity/lore/portrait; editors
(`!isAnonymous()`) change D&D stats directly in the tabs (and the Builder), while
anonymous viewers get a clean read-only sheet. Live-play controls (HP ±, trackers,
spell prep, proficiency toggles) follow the same gate.

Everything can be entered by hand. The only math done here is universal D&D arithmetic that
holds regardless of content — ability modifiers `⌊(score−10)/2⌋` and proficiency totals
(`mod + PB` when proficient). It has **no dependencies** and works entirely standalone.

## Designed to grow

- **Rules in harmony (later):** the sheet *soft-uses* the `dnd55e-core-rules` engine (which
  reads `dnd55e-compendium` data) to auto-fill stats from class/species/background choices
  and to turn free-text fields into dropdowns. If those addons are absent, the sheet falls
  back to manual entry — installing/uninstalling them never breaks a sheet.
- **Localization:** all UI strings flow through a vendored `i18n.js` that mirrors the host's
  localization design (English source of truth, per-locale catalogs layered on top, browser
  default, per-key English fallback). v1 ships English only; adding a language is dropping a
  `strings/<locale>.js` and one `registerCatalog` call — no rewrite.

## Develop

No build step (browser ES modules). From a sibling checkout of the host:

```sh
node scripts/dev-install-addon.cjs ../dnd_5.5e_character_sheets_addon   # from the ttrpg-codex repo
```

Run the client smoke test (assumes the host repo is a sibling directory):

```sh
node --test tests/smoke.mjs
```
